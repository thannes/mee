We traveled to Nigeria to shoot with the Black Eagles and interviewed stars like John Obi Milkel.In Ecuador we profiled coach Reinaldo Rueda and we shot a home-story with goalkeeper Alexander Dominguez. We went with Luis Saritama to the middle of the World. And we told the tragic story of Christian Benitez. In Australia coach Ange Postecoglu gave us an insight into his thoughts and life. With Uruguay we scored a very, very rare exclusive interview with superstar Luis Suarez (and with Diego Forlan, Captain Diego Lugano and Coach Oscar Tabarez). We spent a very interesting week in Teheran, meeting coach Carlos Quieroz, driving around with the legendary Ali Daei in his Maserati, and shooting the Teheran-Derby with 100 000 men in the stadium - no women allowed! South Korean coach Hong Myung-Bo explained us his philosophy and looked back on his career as the best player who ever played for his country. In Honduras coach Luis Fernando Suarez opened his doors for us. Jorge Claros told us the dramatic story of the shooting that almost cost his life. In Costa Rica we showed the private life of Michael Umana and of Celso Borges, we caught up with coach Jorge Luis Pinto. We had an exclusive interview with Colombia's rising young star James Rodriguez and we shot with Faryd Mondragon, who became the oldest player ever playing in a World Cup. Please enjoy the video-samples from our trips around the football world!",

We developed a unique system that allowed each broadcaster to put the stories together in its own style. After we profiled 12 teams in 2006 we delivered extensive material in 2010 from 16 countries, covering all of Africa, South America, the CONCACAF-area as well as Australia and New Zealand. As always we made sure to deliver top quality: no quick sound bites but nicely lit in-depth interviews, no mics in the shot, well produced features and of course all in High Definition. Our goal was not only to show the player or coach but also the story behind him. Since this was the first World Cup on African soil, we dedicated a special to football in Africa. Please enjoy some samples of our stories.",
